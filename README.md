# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim:

To explore the fundamentals of UI and UX, differentiate between UI and UX using real-world case studies, understand their relationship in design, and demonstrate various UI/UX design tools through hands-on tasks.

## Algorithm:
Study the basic concepts of UI and UX. Identify differences between UI and UX using examples. Create a simple persona and user flow to illustrate UX. Design basic wireframes to demonstrate UI layout. Use UI/UX tools (Figma, Canva, Balsamiq, etc.) to create sample designs. Analyze how UI and UX work together to improve product usability. Document outputs and compile them into the lab report.

## Output:
[UI UX LAB - 01.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23774713/UI.UX.LAB.-.01.pdf)


## Result:
The fundamentals of UI and UX were explored successfully. The experiment helped differentiate UI and UX clearly, understand their interconnection, and gain hands-on experience with popular UI/UX design tools. The created wireframes, flows, and tool demonstrations show the complete design process from concept to interface.
